/*
 This example is for Series 1 and 2 XBee (no changes needed for either).

 It listens for incoming packets and echoes back any data received back
 to the sender. This example shows how to use XBeeWithCallbacks to
 concisely express reading of response packets.

 This example assumes an Arduino with two serial ports (like the
 Leonardo or Mega). Replace Serial and Serial1 below appropriately for
 your hardware.
